On the [login page](/#sonarcloud#/sessions/new), just click on the "Log in with Bitbucket" button.\n\n## Install SonarCloud add-on for Bitbucket Cloud\n\nOur Bitbucket Cloud application allows users to automate the SonarCloud analysis with Pipelines. It also allows users to view their SonarCloud metrics directly on Bitbucket Cloud via our Code Quality widget and the decoration of pull-requests.\n\nIn Bitbucket Cloud, go to your team\'s "Settings > Find integrations" page, search for "SonarCloud" in the "Code Quality" category and click on "Add" to install the application.\n\n## Analyzing with Pipelines\n\nSonarCloud integrates with Bitbucket Pipelines to make it easier to trigger analyses. Follow the steps:\n\n1.  On SonarCloud, open and follow the "New Project" tutorial available from the `+` icon available at the top right part of the screen. You can copy-paste the command line displayed at the end.\n\n2.  On Bitbucket Cloud, go to the "Settings > Pipelines > Environment variables" page of your team, and add a new SONAR_TOKEN variable that contains the value of the SonarCloud token (something like `9ad01c85336b265406fa6554a9a681a4b281135f`) which you created during the [tutorial](/#sonarcloud#/onboarding) (and which is available inside the command line that you copy-pasted). **Make sure that you click on the "Lock" icon to encrypt and hide this token.**\n\n3.  Inside the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file of your repository, copy the command line provided by the tutorial and replace the actual token by its variable name. For example, for a Java Maven-based project, you should have something like:\n\n```\nscript:\n  -mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io -Dsonar.organization=my-team-org -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_TOKEN\n```\n\nWhen this change on `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` is committed and pushed, Pipelines should automatically run a new build and therefore trigger the analysis of the repository. Shortly after, your project will appear on SonarCloud in your organization.\n\n4.  Once you see your project in SonarCloud, go to the Bitbucket Cloud "Settings > SonarCloud" page of your repository and find it in the select box to link it.\n\nFrom now on, everytime Pipelines triggers a build, SonarCloud will:\n\n* Analyze every new branch that contains the change on the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file.\n* Analyze and decorate every pull request based on such a branch.\n\n## Quality widget\n\nSonarCloud provides a widget that shows the current quality metrics of your project directly on the repository\'s Overview page on Bitbucket Cloud.\n\nIf you have configured the analysis with Pipelines as described above, you will see this widget on the "Overview" page of your repository.\n\nIf you haven\'t configured the analysis with Pipelines (maybe because you are using another CI tool), follow these few steps:\n\n1.  Go to the repository where you want to display the widget. On the "Overview" page, you should see an empty SonarCloud widget. Click on the link inside the empty widget or just go directly to your repository\'s "Settings > SonarCloud Settings".\n\n2.  If you\'re not already logged in on SonarCloud, do it by using the options provided there. You can log in with Bitbucket Cloud by clicking on the blue button, or click on "More options" to log in with GitHub or VSTS.\n\n3.  Once you\'re logged in on SonarCloud, you should see a dropdown allowing you to choose one of the projects you administer. Just choose the one you want to link to this Bitbucket repository and click "Save".\n\n4.  You can now go back to your repository\'s Overview page on Bitbucket and see the widget with all current SonarCloud metrics displayed.\n\nIf you want to hide this widget (e.g. because your repository is not analyzed on SonarCloud), you can go to the "Settings > SonarCloud" page of your repository and check "Hide repository overview widget".\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Do you have a sample project on Bitbucket Cloud?**\nFor the time being, you can take a look at this very simple JS project: [Sample project analysed on SonarCloud](https://bitbucket.org/bellingard/fab)\n\n**Pipelines can\'t find sonar-scanner**\nIf you want to analyze a non-Java project (JS, TS, PHP, Python, Go, ...), you will need to download and install the [Scanner CLI](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/install-configure-scanner.html) during the execution of your build prior to the actual code scan. You have two options:\n\n* You can download it (with curl for instance) from the links available on the documentation page and unpack it (preferably in a cached folder for later reuse).\n* On Node environments, you can rely on a [community NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sonarqube-scanner) to install it globally and therefore make it available in the PATH.\n\n**I don\'t see the any quality information whereas I configured everything**\nMake sure that your browser is not using some extensions like AdBlocks. They tend to break the integration of third-party applications in BitBucket Cloud.\n\n## Upcoming features and improvements\n\nThere are various areas in which you can expect new features and improvements:\n\n* Tighter integration with Pipelines (less parameters to pass on the CLI, availability of the scanner, ...)\n* Pull request decoration with inline comments to show the issues within the PR\n* Better and easier team onboarding\n* Automatic analysis (i.e. no need to configure anything from Pipelines)\n'}}]);
