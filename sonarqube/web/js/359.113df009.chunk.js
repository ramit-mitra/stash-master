An HTTP POST request including a JSON payload is sent to each URL. URLs may be specified at both the project and global levels. Project-level specification does not replace global-level webhooks. All hooks at both levels are called.\nPlugins\n\nThe HTTP(S) call:\n\n* is made regardless of the status of the Background Task\n* includes a JSON document as payload, using the POST method\n* has a content type of "application/json", with UTF-8 encoding\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can configure up to 10 webhooks in in **Administration > Webhooks**.\n\nAn additional set of 10 webhooks can be configured at the global level in **Administration > Configuration > Webhooks**.\n\nIf configured, all 20 will be executed.\n\n## Delivery and Payload\n\n### Delivery\n\nThe Webhook administration console shows the result and timestamp of the most recent delivery of each webhook with the payload available via the list icon. Results and payloads of earlier deliveries are available from the tools menu to the right of each webhook\n\nResponse records are purged after 30 days.\n\nThe URL must respond within 10 seconds or the delivery is marked as failed.\n\n### Payload\n\nAn HTTP header "X-SonarQube-Project" with the project key is sent to allow quick identification of the project involved\n\nThe Payload is a JSON document which includes:\n\n* when the analysis was performed: see "analysedAt"\n* the identification of the project analyzed: see "project"\n* each Quality Gate criterion checked and its status: see "qualityGate"\n* the Quality Gate status of the project: see "qualityGate.status"\n* the status and the identifier of the Background Task : see "status" and "taskId"\n* user-specified properties: see "properties"\n\n#### Example\n\n```\n{\n    "analysedAt": "2016-11-18T10:46:28+0100",\n    "project": {\n        "key": "org.sonarqube:example",\n        "name": "Example"\n    },\n    "properties": {\n    },\n    "qualityGate": {\n        "conditions": [\n            {\n                "errorThreshold": "1",\n                "metric": "new_security_rating",\n                "onLeakPeriod": true,\n                "operator": "GREATER_THAN",\n                "status": "OK",\n                "value": "1"\n            },\n            {\n                "errorThreshold": "1",\n                "metric": "new_reliability_rating",\n                "onLeakPeriod": true,\n                "operator": "GREATER_THAN",\n                "status": "OK",\n                "value": "1"\n            },\n            {\n                "errorThreshold": "1",\n                "metric": "new_maintainability_rating",\n                "onLeakPeriod": true,\n                "operator": "GREATER_THAN",\n                "status": "OK",\n                "value": "1"\n            },\n            {\n                "errorThreshold": "80",\n                "metric": "new_coverage",\n                "onLeakPeriod": true,\n                "operator": "LESS_THAN",\n                "status": "NO_VALUE"\n            }\n        ],\n        "name": "SonarQube way",\n        "status": "OK"\n    },\n    "serverUrl": "http://localhost:9000",\n    "status": "SUCCESS",\n    "taskId": "AVh21JS2JepAEhwQ-b3u"\n}\n```\n\n## Additional parameters\n\nA basic authentication mechanism is supported by providing user/password in the URL of the Webhook such as `https://myLogin:myPassword@my_server/foo`.\n\nIf you provide additional properties to your SonarQube Scanner using the pattern `sonar.analysis.*`, these properties will be automatically added to the section "properties" of the payload.\n\nFor example these additional parameters:\n\n```\nsonar-scanner -Dsonar.analysis.scmRevision=628f5175ada0d685fd7164baa7c6382c1f25cab4 -Dsonar.analysis.buildNumber=12345\n```\n\nWould add this to the payload:\n\n```\n"properties": {\n  "sonar.analysis.scmRevision": "628f5175ada0d685fd7164baa7c6382c1f25cab4",\n  "sonar.analysis.buildNumber": "12345"\n}\n```\n'}}]);
