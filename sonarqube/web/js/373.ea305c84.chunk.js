This is not editable.\n\n## Issue Creation and Synchronization\n\nDuring the **first analysis only**, issues (type, severity, status, assignee, change log, comments) are synchronized with the Main Branch. In each synchronized issue, a comment is added to the change log of the issue on the long-lived branch: \"The issue has been copied from branch 'master' to branch yyy\".\n\nThen, at each subsequent analysis of the long-lived branch, any new issue that comes from a short-lived branch automatically inherits the attributes (type, severity, ...) the issue had in the short-lived branch. A comment is added to the change log of the issue on the long-lived branch: \"The issue had been copied from branch 'the short-live branch' to branch yyy\".\n\n## Leak Period\n\nBecause long-lived branches will persist for a long time, you are likely to develop and release multiple versions from it, and so you can change the Leak Period of a long-lived branch in **Administration > Branches**.\n\n## Settings and Quality Profiles on Branches\n\nBranch settings and quality profiles default to those set for the master branch, and by design, it's not possible to configure other values.\n"}}]);
