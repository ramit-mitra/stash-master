This is not editable.\\n\\n## Issue Creation and Synchronization\\n\\nDuring the **first analysis only**, issues (type, severity, status, assignee, change log, comments) are synchronized with the Main Branch. In each synchronized issue, a comment is added to the change log of the issue on the long-lived branch: \\\"The issue has been copied from branch 'master' to branch yyy\\\".\\n\\nThen, at each subsequent analysis of the long-lived branch, any new issue that comes from a short-lived branch automatically inherits the attributes (type, severity, ...) the issue had in the short-lived branch. A comment is added to the change log of the issue on the long-lived branch: \\\"The issue had been copied from branch 'the short-live branch' to branch yyy\\\".\\n\\n## Leak Period\\n\\nBecause long-lived branches will persist for a long time, you are likely to develop and release multiple versions from it, and so you can change the Leak Period of a long-lived branch in **Administration > Branches**.\\n\\n## Settings and Quality Profiles on Branches\\n\\nBranch settings and quality profiles default to those set for the master branch, and by design, it's not possible to configure other values.\\n\""],"sourceRoot":""}
