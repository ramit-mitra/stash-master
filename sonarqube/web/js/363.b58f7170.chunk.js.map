Depending on their permisssions within the organization, members can:\\n* Analyse projects\\n* Manage project settings (permissions, visibility, quality profiles, ...)\\n* Update issues\\n* Manage quality gates and quality profiles\\n* Administer the organization itself\\n\\n## Adding Members\\n\\nAdding members is done on the \\\"Members\\\" page of the organization, and this can be done only by an administrator of \\nthe organization.\\n\\nAdding a user as a member is possible only if that user has already signed up on SonarCloud. If the user never authenticated to\\nthe system, the administrator will simply not be able to find the user in the search modal window.\\n\\n## Granting permissions\\n\\nOnce added, a user can be granted permissions to perform various operations in the organization. It is up to the \\nadministrator who added the user to make sure that she gets the relevant permissions.\\n\\nOrganization admins will prefer to create groups to manage permissions, and add new users to those\\ngroups through the \\\"Members\\\" page. With such an approach, they won't have to manage individal permissions at\\nproject level for instance.\\n\\n## Future evolutions\\n\\nFuture versions of SonarCloud will make this onboarding process easier thanks to better integrations with GitHub, \\nBitbucket Cloud and VSTS: users won't have to sign up prior to joining an organization, and their permissions will \\nbe retrieved at best from the ones existing on the other systems.\\n\""],"sourceRoot":""}
